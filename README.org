#+DESCRIPTION: My Nix flake

I only use Nix on my laptop, therefore this configuration is specific to my laptop; however the auto-generated
~hardware-configuration.nix~ is omitted from the repo, seeing as it isn't going to be useful for anyone else.

If you have any questions/suggestions, my contact information is below.
